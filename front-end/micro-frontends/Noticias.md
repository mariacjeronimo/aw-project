## Title
Noticias
## Context and Responsibility
This microfrontend consolidates all functionalities related to meat-related news. This includes the highlighted news articles, articles in their entirety, and related news.
## Decisions
We believe that this division is acceptable business-wise, as there should be a team specifically dedicated to managing the news section of the app. By consolidating all news-related functionalities within the Noticias microfrontend, we adhere to the principle of Single Responsibility, ensuring that the team responsible for managing news content can focus solely on this aspect without being burdened by unrelated features. This promotes clarity in responsibility and fosters efficiency in development and maintenance processes.
## Consequences
* Good:
1. By dedicating a microfrontend solely to news-related functionalities, we ensure that the team responsible can focus exclusively on managing and updating news content, improving efficiency and accountability.
2. Teams can deploy updates or changes to the Noticias microfrontend independently, allowing for faster iteration and reducing dependencies on other parts of the application.
3. The dedicated team managing the Noticias microfrontend can work autonomously, taking ownership of the news section and making decisions tailored to its specific requirements.
* Bad:
1. As the application grows and evolves, the Noticias microfrontend may become too large and unwieldy, leading to performance issues and difficulties in maintaining and extending its functionality.
