## Title
CartaoProduto
## Context and Responsibility
This microfrontend contains the Highlights section on the Homepage with the cards, the product's page photo, name, and price components, and the Saved page's contents. Additionally, it encapsulates the All products section on the Specified location page.
## Decisions
Despite the content of the microfrontend being spread across diverse pages, we believe that this approach maximizes code reusability. Specifically, the card containing meat information (photo, name, price, location) is utilized in multiple places across the app, promoting consistency and reducing redundancy. Similarly, the header of the product's page, which shares information with the main page's cards, is included in this microfrontend to leverage code reuse. Following this logic, we also integrated the All products section from the Specified location page, as it shares the same information, further enhancing code reuse and maintainability.
## Consequences
* Good:
1. By consolidating similar components within the CartaoProduto microfrontend, such as cards and headers, we promote code reuse across different parts of the application. This not only reduces redundancy but also enhances consistency and maintainability.
2. Utilizing the same components across various pages ensures a consistent user experience, improving usability and reducing cognitive load for users.
3. Development and maintenance efforts are streamlined by managing related components within a single microfrontend, facilitating easier updates and enhancements.
* Bad:
1. Introducing changes or updates to the CartaoProduto microfrontend may require careful coordination with other teams or components that rely on its functionality. This dependency can potentially slow down development cycles and increase the complexity of version management.
