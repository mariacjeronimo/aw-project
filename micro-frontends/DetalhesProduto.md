## Title
DetalhesProduto
## Context and Responsibility
This microfrontend consolidates the button that opens the QR code reader, the pop-up that shows once the QR code is successfully read, the Details section on the product's page, the button to expand details, and all the expanded details as well as the nutritional information.
## Decisions
Even though the components of this microfrontend are spread out across multiple pages, we considered that all of this information is related and should be managed by the same team. This decision aligns with the principle of Single Responsibility, ensuring that the DetalhesProduto microfrontend is focused solely on product detail-related functionalities. 
## Consequences
* Good:
1. The DetalhesProduto microfrontend is dedicated solely to product detail-related functionalities, reducing complexity and improving code organization.
* Bad:
1. Introducing changes or updates to the DetalhesProduto microfrontend may require careful coordination with other teams or components that rely on its functionality. This dependency can potentially slow down development cycles and increase the complexity of version management.
